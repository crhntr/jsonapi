# A JSON API Library (not framework)

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/crhntr/jsonapi?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/crhntr/jsonapi)

**This package is in early development and is definitely not stable!**

## Key Ideas
* Handlers inspired by http.Handler.
* Maximize flexibility for model/business logic implementation
* Minimize (or abstain) from use of Reflection
* Simple Mux
* A few resonably large example apps
* BDD Tests to further inspire if example apps are not enough

## Links
* Based on [`{json:api}`](https://jsonapi.org/)
