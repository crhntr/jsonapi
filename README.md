# A JSON API Library (not framework)

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/crhntr/jsonapi?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/crhntr/jsonapi)

**This package is in early development and is definitely not stable!**

## Key Ideas
* Handlers inspired by http.Handler.
* Maximize flexibility for model/business logic implementation
* Minimize (or abstain) from use of Reflection
* A few reasonably large example apps
* Document BDD tests well to further show usage if example apps are not sufficient

... maybe also

* write a cli to generate based on API YAML
  * also generate default database/models

## Links
* Based on [`{json:api}`](https://jsonapi.org/)
